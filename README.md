# linux_local_server
**linux based local server for embedded applications**

This project focuses on providing a universal local server program, so any embedded system developer or hobbyist developers can use it from any device like Personal computers, Microcontroller boards with Wi-Fi or Ethernet connected, different embedded boards built with ARM, AVR, Aversion controllers, for their purpose. 

This server is a local server and can be used for different applications like Data Acquisition, Internet of Things, Web and Mobile applications etc.purpose.
 For Database management MySQL Relational Database Management service will be used. This will give flexibility to users to add, search, remove and to create the report from stored data. 
 
 The data stored in the MySQL database can be accessed by different methods such as Webpage, Mobile Application, Linux Application. The stored data will also be processed for Machine Learning purposes or Artificial Intelligence prediction. 
 
 The main purpose behind this Linux server is to overcome some flaws of embedded systems like Storage capacity, restrictions of Paid cloud services like the limited data storage with limited request per second and the security issues in the public cloud. 

**Tech Stack:- Linux Socket, C API for MySQL, JSON.**
